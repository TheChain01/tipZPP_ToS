Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.

Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.

# Improve WildCards services

We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones.

If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues.

# What we expect from you
Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms

The permission we give you to use our services continues as long as you meet your responsibilities in:
these terms
service-specific additional terms, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements

Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in the services.

# Respect others

Our services allow you to interact with others. We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:
comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws
respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others
don’t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services
Our service-specific additional terms and policies provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. For example, it is highly recommended to report abusive users to our support email. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide a fair process as described in the Taking action in case of problems section.

# Using WildCards

You’re responsible for what you do with your WildCards Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your WildCards Account secure.

If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.

# Content in WildCards
WildCards content
Some of our services include content that belongs to WildCards dev team. You may use WildCards’ content as allowed by these terms and any service-specific additional terms, but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices.

# Software in WildCards

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software. Also, you may not reverse engineer or attempt to extract any of our source code unless you have our written permission or applicable law lets you do so.

When a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available.

# In case of problems or disagreements
By law, you have the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong. These terms don’t limit or take away any of those rights. For example, if you’re a consumer, then you continue to enjoy all legal rights granted to consumers under applicable law.

# Warranty
We provide our services using reasonable skill and care. If we don’t meet the quality level described in this warranty, you agree to tell us and we’ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.

# Disclaimers
The only commitments we make about our services (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are (1) described in the Warranty section, (2) stated in the service-specific additional terms, or (3) provided under applicable laws. We don’t make any other commitments about our services.

And unless required by law, we don’t provide implied warranties, such as the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

# Liabilities
For all users
These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law. Specifically, these terms don’t limit WildCards’ liability for death or personal injury, fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.

Other than the rights and responsibilities described in this section (In case of problems or disagreements), WildCards won’t be responsible for any other losses, unless they’re caused by our breach of these terms or service-specific additional terms.

For business users and organizations only
If you’re a business user or organization, then to the extent allowed by applicable law:

You’ll indemnify WildCards and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the services or violation of these terms or service-specific additional terms. This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees.
WildCards won’t be responsible for the following liabilities:
loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings
indirect or consequential loss
punitive damages
WildCards’ total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) US$500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach
If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms.

# Taking action in case of problems
Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to fix the problem, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:

-cause harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google
-violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order
-compromise an investigation
-compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our services

# Suspending or terminating your access to WildCards services
WildCards reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your WildCards Account if any of these things happen:

-you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies
-we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
-we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you
-If you believe your WildCards Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal by contacting our support email listed on our support page.

# Refunds
No refund will be issued under any circumstances. All in-app purchases are final sales. If you deleted your account by accident, you can send us an email and we will evaluate your case and act accordingly. We reserve the right to refuse to refund or upgrade your account depending on the case sent to us. AGAIN, ALL SALES ARE FINAL.

Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we’d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services. No refunds will be issued if you decide to delete your WildCards account. 

# Settling disputes, governing law, and courts
For information about how to contact WildCards, please visit our contact page.

Ontario law will govern all disputes arising out of or relating to these terms, service-specific additional terms, or any related services, regardless of conflict of laws rules. These disputes will be resolved exclusively in the federal or provincial courts of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and you and WildCards consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

To the extent that applicable local law prevents certain disputes from being resolved in a Ontario court, then you can file those disputes in your local courts. Likewise, if applicable local law prevents your local court from applying Ontario law to resolve these disputes, then these disputes will be governed by the applicable local laws of your country, state, or other place of residence.


# About these terms
By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.

These terms describe the relationship between you and WildCards. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.

We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.

If these terms conflict with the service-specific additional terms, the additional terms will govern for that service.

If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

If you don’t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.

We may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.

If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove your content and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your WildCards Account.
